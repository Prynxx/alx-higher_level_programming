# Prynxx  General

* Python programming is awesome because it is a high-level, interpreted, interactive, and object-oriented scripting language.
* An object is an instance of a class. It is a data structure that contains data and instructions related to the data.
* A class is a blueprint or template from which objects are created. An object or instance is an individual instance of a class.
* An immutable object is an object whose state cannot be modified after it is created. A mutable object is an object whose state can be modified after it is created.
* A reference is a name that refers to a value stored in memory.
* An assignment is the process of storing a value in a memory location.
* An alias is an alternative name for a variable.
* To know if two variables are identical, you can use the 'is' operator.
* To know if two variables are linked to the same object, you can use the 'is' operator.
* To display the variable identifier (which is the memory address in the cpython implementation), you can use the 'id()' function.
* Mutable objects can be modified after they are created, while immutable objects cannot be modified after they are created.
* The built-in mutable types in Python are lists, dictionaries, and sets.
* The built-in immutable types in Python are strings, tuples, and numbers.
* Python passes variables to functions by reference.
